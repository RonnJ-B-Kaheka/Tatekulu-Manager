### Trade-offs for Tatekulu App

- **Stripe**: Best for growth, but impossible to use without a foreign entity (e.g., UK/US LLC).
- **PayPal**: Good for international tourists, but a nightmare for the business owner to access funds (requires FNB South Africa account).
- **Local (DPO/PayToday)**: **Recommended.** Best for local cash flow and integration with Namibian banking systems.
